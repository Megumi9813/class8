        <div class="contents">Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Define the goal</li>
            <p>First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.</p>
            <li>Design the script</li>
            <p>To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.</p>
            <li>Code each step</li>
            <p>Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.</p>
        </ul>
        <div class="contents-title">Expressions</div>
        <p>An expression evaluates into (results in)a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expressions that just assign a value to a variable</li>
            <p>In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator.</p>
            <div class="contents-item">var color = 'beige';</div>
            <p>The value of color is now beige.</p>
            <li>Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value</li>
            <p>You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. for example:</p>
            <div class="contents-item">var area = 3*2;</div>
            <p>The value of area is now 6</p>
        </ul>
        <div class="contents-title">Loops</div>
        <ul>
            <li>For Loop<br /></li>
            <p>If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop. In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.</p>
            <li>While</li>
            <p>If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.</p>
        </ul>
